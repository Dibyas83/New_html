Here are key points about the id attribute: 
Uniqueness: The value of the id attribute must be unique within the entire HTML document. No two elements should share the same id.
Case Sensitivity: The id is case-sensitive. For example, "myId" is different from "MyId".
Accessing Elements: JavaScript uses methods like document.getElementById() to access elements based on their id. This allows for targeted manipulation of specific elements.
CSS Styling: CSS uses the # symbol followed by the id to apply specific styles to a unique element.
Manipulation: Once an element is selected using its id, JavaScript can modify its content, style, or behavior.
Global Attribute: The id attribute is a global attribute, meaning it can be used on any HTML element.
No Spaces: The id value should not contain spaces.
Here is an example of how to use it:
Code

 <div id="myDiv">This is a div.</div>
JavaScript

 const myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");
 console.log(myDiv.innerHTML); // Output: "This is a div."
 -->>
